        <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Since the nineties when Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is introduced to solve software development issues, we keep using the same concepts over and over. In the same time, our needs are in a changing mode that is influenced by the changed in several factors like computing infrastructure, and human resources. Nowadays, cloud computing is taking its way to dominate the IT infrastructure, and the concept of remote employee is spreading all over industries. Thus, enhancing the concepts of OOP and add others to keep up with the changes around us is mandatory. Therefore, Process Oriented Programming (POP) is a different way to develop software that has capabilities to keep up with the changes that we experience.</p>
