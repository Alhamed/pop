{"name":"Process-oriented Programming","tagline":"Process-oriented Programming","body":"### Introduction\r\nIn recent years, there has been a speedy growth in the evolution of computer programming in its environs and processes.  A case of note is the rapid expansion, yet, effective and reliable than ever remote software development tools and practices. In response to meet these fast-changing methods, programmers and system developers are in dire need for a favorable programming paradigm technique or solution which will keep pace in coping up with the optimum needs and rapid changes in the world of computer programming and technology. Process-Oriented Programming is one innovative solution model for these transformations. In this research, we will define the major component of this modelâ€™s programming approach which actually relies upon the processes. Later, we will use and explore two POP applications as tests for this approach. As our conclusion, we will necessitate accepting its methodology and conform through to it as developed by these tests.\r\n\r\n### The News of Process Oriented Programming (POP)\r\nYou can visit the [POP's blog for the latest news](http://process-oriented-programming.blogspot.com/)\r\n\r\n### The Specifications of Process Oriented Programming (POP)\r\nYou can visit the [POP's wiki for the specifications](https://github.com/Alhamed/pop/wiki)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
